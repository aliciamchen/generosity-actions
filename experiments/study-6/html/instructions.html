    Imagine that you are traveling very far away, and meet a new group of people
    you know nothing about. You are trying to learn about the people, the
    society, and the language, all at the same time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on your identity, your work, and/or your roles, you are (or want to
    be) in different kinds of relationships with the people in the society.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some of the relationships, you have <em>more</em> power/status/influence
    than the other person, in other relationships you have the
    <em>same amount of</em> power/status/influence as the other person, and in
    other relationships you have <em>less</em> power/status/influence than the
    other person.
  </p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>
    In this study, you will be interacting with different members of this
    society in a variety of daily-life social interactions. The people you
    interact with all know the social rules and norms of the society, and act
    based on these social norms.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will tell you about the kind of relationship you are in (or want to be
    in) with each partner: whether they have more, equal, or less
    power/status/influence than you.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each of these interactions, there are two actions that both you and your
    partner need to choose between. One of the choices benefits you more than
    your partner, the other choice benefits your partner more than you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on what you choose to do and based on what your partner chooses to do,
    the social interaction will either occur smoothly ‚ò∫Ô∏è or look socially
    awkward üò¨.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you look awkward, it looks like you haven't figured out the rules and
    norms of the society.

  <p>
    You will interact with 6 total partners. You will interact with each partner
    twice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each time you interact with a partner, we will show you a description of a
    short scenario and will ask you to choose an action.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <em>first time</em> you interact with a partner, we will show you what
    your partner selected, and what happened during the social interaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <em>second time</em> you interact with a partner, we will show you a
    reminder of your first interaction, and then ask you to choose an action
    again.
  </p>

<div class="align-left">
  <p>You can earn up to 2 points for each interaction:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You will receive <strong>2 points</strong> if the social interaction
      occurs smoothly and you benefit <em>more</em> than your partner from the
      social interaction.
    </li>
    <li>
      You will receive <strong>1 point</strong> if the social interaction occurs
      smoothly and you benefit <em>less</em> than your partner from the social
      interaction.
    </li>
    <li>
      You will receive <strong>0 points</strong> if the social interaction
      looks awkward.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that for the <em>second</em> interaction, we will not show you any
    feedback on whether the interaction occurred smoothly or not, but your
    response will still contribute to your total score.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of the study, we will show you your total score, and you will
    receive a bonus of up to $3.00 based on how many points you earned. Please
    make sure to read each scenario carefully, so that you can earn as many
    points as possible.
