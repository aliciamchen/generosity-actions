    Imagine that you are traveling very far away, and meet a new group of people
    you know nothing about. You are trying to learn about the people, the
    society, and the language, all at the same time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on your identity, your work, and/or your roles, you are (or want to
    be) in different kinds of relationships with the people in the society.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some of the relationships, you have <em>more</em> power/status/influence
    than the other person, in other relationships you have the
    <em>same amount of</em> power/status/influence as the other person, and in
    other relationships you have <em>less</em> power/status/influence than the
    other person.
  </p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>
    In this study, you will be interacting with different members of this
    society in a variety of daily-life social interactions.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will tell you about the kind of relationship you are in (or want to be
    in) with each partner: whether they have more, equal, or less
    power/status/influence than you.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each of these interactions, there are two actions that both you and your
    partner need to choose between.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on what you choose to do and based on what your partner chooses to do,
    the social interaction will either occur smoothly ‚ò∫Ô∏è or look socially
    awkward üò¨.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you look awkward, it looks like you haven't figured out the rules and
    norms of the society. Your goal is to have as many interactions as possible
    occur smoothly.
  </p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<div class="align-left">
  <p>
    You will interact with 6 total partners. You will interact with each partner
    twice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each time you interact with a partner, we will show you a description of a
    short scenario and will ask you to choose an action.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <em>first time</em> you interact with a partner, we will show you what
    your partner selected, and what happened during the social interaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <em>second time</em> you interact with a partner, we will show you a
    reminder of your first interaction, and then ask you to choose an action
    again.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can earn 1 point for each interaction. You will receive 1 point if the
    social interaction occurs smoothly, and 0 points if you look socially
    awkward.
  </p>
  <p>
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that for the <em>second</em> interaction, we will not show you any
    feedback on whether the interaction occurred smoothly or not, but your
    response will still contribute to your total score.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of the study, we will show you your total score, and you will
    receive a bonus of up to $3.00 based on how many points you earned. Please
    make sure to read each scenario carefully, so that you can earn as many
    points as possible.
