    Imagine that you are traveling very far away, and meet a new group of people
    you know nothing about. You are trying to learn about the people, the
    society, and the language, all at the same time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on your identity, your work, and/or your roles, there are people who
    have <em>more</em> power/status/influence than you, people who have the
    <em>same amount of</em>
    power/status/influence as you, and people who have <em>less</em>
    power/status/influence than you.

  <p>
    In this study, you will be interacting with different members of this
    society in a variety of daily-life social interactions.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each of these interactions, there are two actions that you need to
    choose between.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you and your partner choose <em>different actions</em>, the social
    interaction will occur smoothly; if both of you choose the
    <em>same action</em>, you look socially awkward and like you haven't figured
    out the norms of the society.

<div class="align-left">
  <p>
    You will interact with 6 total partners. You will interact with each partner
    twice.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em
      >We will <em>tell</em> you whether each partner has more, equal, or less
      power/status/influence than you.</em
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Each time you interact with a partner, we will ask you to choose an action.
    Then, we will show you what your partner selected, and what happened during
    the social interaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will receive 1 point if the social interaction occurs smoothly (i.e. you
    and your partner choose different actions), and 0 points if you look
    socially awkward (i.e. you and your partner choose the same action).
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of the study, you will receive a bonus of up to $XXX based on how
    many points you earned.
