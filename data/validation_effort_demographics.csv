However, those two options weren't listed in the answers. I selected ""extremely"" and ""not at all"", as it seemed that you wanted the two opposite extremes as answers. I hope this is acceptable."

Like the question about 2 people going shopping and one carrying the bags up.  I put no effort by the person who didn't carry the bags up but obviously they had some effort going shopping.

Also the attention checks selections didn't match what you were asking me to select.  The second one said to choose Extremely Unlikely but that wasn't one of the options so I picked not at all."
