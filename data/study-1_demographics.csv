It seems like the answer is always going to be somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, or neither because you never have enough info to feel strongly one way or the other. I would prefer to choose neither every time. This is frustrating!

The last question about how the expect to not do whatever in the future is kind of frustrating because, why would I ever know that? Am I expected to fill in the blanks myself? If I must fill in the blanks, I have a tendency to say, “what if,” and make all the variables positive. I feel like you want me to make assumptions and I just don’t do that because I’m just not a judgmental person or my threshold for making judgments about people and situations is bigger… or smaller… I just don’t like to do it unless I absolutely must and I have a whole lot of information.

And something else... I think this was the first question and it doesn't make sense gramatically.

Consider Matt and William, who like to go to an Italian restaurant near their workplace, and met up for a meal this week. Matt and William are in an asymmetric relationship. Scheduling-wise, Matt prefers lunches, because Matt likes to have a free schedule after work. William prefers dinners because William prefers not to break up the work day by traveling somewhere after lunch. This week, they got dinner on Wednesday at 7pm. How likely is it that

They like to go to an Italian restaurant and met up this week? Did they or didn't they?"
